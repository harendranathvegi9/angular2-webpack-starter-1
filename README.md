This is a basic Angular2 Webpack starter app. It features Ahead-of-Time compilation for production and a development server.

### Requirements

[Compass](http://compass-style.org) is required (or you can modify the `start`script in `package.json`).

### Installation

Run `yarn` or `npm install` in the project after cloning it.

### Development

Run `npm start` to run the Webpack development server. Visit http://localhost:4200 in your browser.

### AoT/Production

Run `npm run build` to bundle the application. Run `npm run serve` to serve the app with lite-server, then visit http://localhost:3000 in the browser.
